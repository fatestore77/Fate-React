# Privacy Policy for Fate React

**Effective Date:** 11/11/2024

Welcome to Fate React! This privacy policy is designed to inform you about how we handle and protect your data while you use the Fate React bot on Discord. By using this bot, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

Fate React does not collect any personal data from users beyond what is necessary to provide the services it offers within your Discord server. We may interact with your server's data to provide features such as:

- **Custom Reactions:** Fate React allows the server owner to create and delete emojis, stickers, and automate reactions for specific chats.
- **Role-based Access:** The bot enables the server owner to assign roles to users who can interact with the bot commands.
- **Game Participation:** Server members can participate in games, such as the fastest person to write, reverse a number, or decode a word, within the server.

## 2. Permissions

To provide its features, Fate React requires certain permissions within the Discord server. These permissions are as follows:

- **Create and Delete Emojis and Stickers:** Fate React may create new emojis or stickers and delete them based on server owner commands.
- **Send Messages and Reactions:** Fate React can send messages, auto-react to messages, and create custom reactions based on commands given by the server owner.
- **Manage Roles:** The server owner can set roles for users to control access to certain bot commands.
- **Access to Text Channels:** Fate React may interact with specific chat channels as designated by the server owner for auto-reacts or automated lines.

## 3. Usage of Data

Fate React only processes the data necessary to provide its functionality. We do not store any personal information or use your data for advertising purposes. The interactions within the bot are solely focused on:

- **Game Interactions:** The bot processes the chat data related to games like fastest writing, number reversals, and word decoding.
- **Server Management:** The bot will store and manage roles and permissions related to server commands and custom reactions, as configured by the server owner.

## 4. Data Storage

Fate React does not store any personal or sensitive data about users beyond the scope of its operations. Any data processed is temporarily used for the purpose of running bot commands and will not be retained long-term unless explicitly required by the server ownerâ€™s setup.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Fate React does not share any collected data with third-party services or entities. The bot operates within the boundaries of the Discord API and respects Discord's Terms of Service.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the data processed by Fate React remains secure and protected. However, as with any online service, we cannot guarantee 100% security.

## 7. Bot Commands and Role Access

The Fate React bot allows the server owner to configure specific roles that can use the bot's commands. This means that only those with the designated roles can perform actions like creating or deleting emojis, triggering auto-reacts, and managing game features.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. Any updates will be posted here, and the revised policy will become effective immediately upon posting.
